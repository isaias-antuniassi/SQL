# Sales Analysis Database - SQL

### Project Overview
---

This project involves the design of a relational database to support sales analysis across multiple stores. The database captures essential details about products, stores, and sales transactions, enabling data-driven insights through SQL queries.

### Database Design

The database consists of three interrelated tables:
1. **Products**: Stores information about items available for sale, including their names, categories, and prices.
2. **Stores**: Contains data about the retail outlets, including their locations and managers.
3. **Sales**: Tracks individual sales transactions, associating products sold with the store and date of sale.
